Andragogic, dude!

What should I learn? It's slowly coming to my attention that if I'm going to make money in a non-subsistance way, I can't just work at Clarke's. A large part of me wanted to take this time in Chicago to step away from that world, but was I ever really *in* it? Programming doesn't constitute the height of life for me, but it's intellectually fun and even though it may take me a little bit to get up to speed, it'll probably provide a substantially higher standard of living than working at a diner. 

So here we are. I've decided the broad strokes of what to do, but a relevant question is, what do I dive into? Programming is not a particularly limited pursuit. At the very least, I'd like to find a cardinal direction to point my attention in. 

There are a few considerations here. First off, what am I interested in? There's really no subset of programming I expressly *dislike*, but like anyone, I have my preferences. I enjoy scientific things, algorithms, data visualization, statistics, and programming for the purpose of solving problems in general. Compilers are great, but I don't know shit about them, and as long as next month's rent is hanging in the balance, now is not the time. Second, what manner of programming will people want from somebody with relatively little experience? As much as I hate to admit it, no matter HOW good I get in the next few months, I'll be inexperienced and have very little professional record. As a consequence, I doubt I'll be paid to do anything that's vital to get correct.

It feels like my most viable route would be the flashy data visualization and statistics road. That is, taking numbers and making them pretty and helpful. There's still math and statistics and algorithms involved, so it'll sate that thirst, but it also has a design component that I really like. Sounds promising! Plus, this way, maybe I can do freelance work but also write for a publication? 

R is lovely, but let's do d3.js. If there's something I need R for, like an actual difficult statistics algorithm, I can always just run the algorithm in R and report the results in Javascript. Let's get to work. Today: learning.
